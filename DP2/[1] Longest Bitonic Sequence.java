/**
 * Given an array with all integers,  a sub-sequence of it is called Bitonic if it is first sorted in an ascending order, 
 * then sorted in a descending order. How can you find the length of the longest bitonic subsequence.

Assumptions:

The given array is not null.
Corner Cases:

A subsequence, sorted in increasing order is considered Bitonic with the decreasing part as empty. 
Similarly, decreasing order sequence is considered Bitonic with the increasing part as empty.
Examples:

{1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 6, 1}, the longest bitonic sub sequence is {1, 3, 4, 6, 1}, length is 5.

 /**
  * This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem. 
  Let the input array be arr[] of length n. We need to construct two arrays lis[] and lds[] using Dynamic Programming solution of LIS problem. 
  lis[i] stores the length of the Longest Increasing subsequence ending with arr[i]. 
  lds[i] stores the length of the longest Decreasing subsequence starting from arr[i]. 
  Finally, we need to return the max value of lis[i] + lds[i] â€“ 1 where i is from 0 to n-1.
